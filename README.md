# TaskManager
Simple task manager app with MVVM architecture / .NET 6.

UI inspired by Traversy Media's Angular Crash Course youtube tutorial, I wanted to make something with MVVM ,the first thing came to my mind was this angular tutorial video, so I remade the UI (kind of). Using only the UWP.Notifications NuGet package, also wanted to use WPF extended tools since vanilla WPF for some reason doesn't offer a timepicker module, but wanted to keep it as simple as possible. 

-Double click to toggle reminder on task.
-X on the task deletes it from the list, and from the JSON.
-The app uses toast notifications.
-You will also get the notification if you close the app entirely.
-Target framework is : 'net6.0-windows10.0.17763.0'.
